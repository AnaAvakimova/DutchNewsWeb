# Website with real Dutch news and images generated by AI

## Description

This website is designed to automatically fetch news articles from a specified website, summarize them, translate the
summaries into English, and show these summaries along with generated images.
It uses:
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping;
- OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for article summarization;
- DeepL AI for translation;
- OpenAI's DALL-E for image generation.


## Features

- This website works autonomously, the script for loading news runs every day by the cron command.
- The website is developed based on the Django framework, using SQLite3 database.
- Each component is dockerized and hosted on my personal Linux-based VPS, behind Nginx and Cloudflare.

## How to run locally with development settings

`python manage.py runserver --settings=DutchNewsWeb.settings.development`
